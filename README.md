# The Odin Project 2 - Landing Page Project

*Note: This website is not meant to look good on mobile devices. Responsive design will be a future lesson in The Odin Project's Curriculum. 

## Project Description:
In this project, I'm tasked with creating a landing page website from scratch using a desired-result image (found in `desired_result/desired-outcome.png`). 

This project is my first experience creating a website with no template or starting code. 

The `desired-outcome.png` features dummy images and text but I chose to theme this website around my favorite baseball team. This is why the colors and positioning of some elements. The Odin Project makes it clear that I should not concern myself with making sure my website is pixel-perfect with the `desired-outcome.png` image.

## Skills Demonstrated:

In this project, I demonstrated my understanding of HTML, CSS, Structuring files within a website, and Git.

A big challenge with this project was taking the CSS flexbox knowledge from previous Odin Project lessons into play. While I did work on flexbox exercises, creating a full website using flexbox for the first time is a whole different beast. I do feel very good with flexbox now! However there is certainly more room to grow.

Additionally, I tried very hard to commit early and commit often using Git. I know that keeping good Git habits will only strengthen my developing and collaborating skills.
